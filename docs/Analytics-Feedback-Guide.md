# Analytics & Feedback System Guide

This document explains the analytics and feedback system for Vibe Coding RulesHub, including data collection, storage, access patterns, and implementation guidelines.

## Overview

The analytics and feedback system collects usage data and user input to:

1. Identify which rules are most valuable to users
2. Understand how rules are being used
3. Gather structured feedback for continuous improvement
4. Measure the impact of rules on development workflows

## Data Collection

### Analytics Events

The system collects the following analytics events:

| Event Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `view` | When a user views a rule's details |
| `download` | When a rule is downloaded |
| `copy` | When a rule's content is copied to clipboard |
| `search` | When a search query is executed |

### Feedback Types

Users can submit three types of feedback:

1. **Issues**: Problems with a rule's content or functionality
2. **Suggestions**: Ideas for improving existing rules
3. **General**: Other comments and ratings

## Database Schema

### Analytics Tables

- `rules_hub.analytics_events`: Raw event data
- `rules_hub.analytics_daily`: Daily aggregated metrics
- `rules_hub.analytics_monthly`: Monthly aggregated metrics
- `rules_hub.search_analytics`: Search query data
- `rules_hub.user_feedback`: User feedback submissions

## Implementation

### Setup

1. Apply the analytics schema extension:
   ```bash
   npm run apply-analytics-schema -- --url=YOUR_SUPABASE_URL --password=YOUR_PASSWORD
   ```

2. Configure API endpoints in your web application:
   - `/api/analytics/event` for tracking rule interactions
   - `/api/analytics/search` for tracking search queries
   - `/api/feedback` for collecting user feedback

### Best Practices

1. **Privacy**: Anonymize personal data and provide clear privacy policies
2. **Performance**: Use batch processing for high-volume events
3. **Security**: Validate all input data and apply proper access controls
4. **Actionability**: Focus on collecting data that drives improvements

## Analytics Reporting

Consider implementing the following reports:

### Usage Reports

- **Rule Popularity**: Top rules by views, downloads, and copies
- **User Engagement**: Time spent viewing rules, return visits
- **Search Behavior**: Common search terms and patterns
- **Usage Trends**: Changes in metrics over time

### Feedback Analysis

- **Issue Reports**: Common problems reported by users
- **Improvement Suggestions**: Aggregate suggestions by category
- **User Ratings**: Average ratings by rule type or category

## Data Retention

Consider the following data retention policies:

- Raw event data: 90 days
- Aggregated daily metrics: 1 year
- Aggregated monthly metrics: Indefinite
- User feedback: Indefinite

## Privacy Considerations

Implement these privacy best practices:

1. Anonymize user identifiers where possible
2. Only collect necessary data
3. Provide clear opt-out mechanisms
4. Comply with applicable privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
5. Include data collection practices in your privacy policy

## Integration with Development Workflow

Use analytics and feedback data to:

1. Prioritize rule updates and improvements
2. Identify gaps in rule coverage
3. Inform the development of new rule categories
4. Measure the impact of rule changes

## Future Enhancements

Consider enhancing the system with:

1. **Predictive Analytics**: Anticipate which rules will be useful based on context
2. **A/B Testing**: Compare different versions of rules
3. **Recommendations**: Suggest related rules based on usage patterns
4. **Integration with IDEs**: Collect data on rule effectiveness within code editors
