> **Transform your AI coding assistant from generic helper to project-aware expert**

Vibe Coding Rules is an intelligent framework that automatically analyzes your codebase and generates tailored rule files (.mdc) that provide context-aware guidance to AI coding assistants. Stop explaining your project structure every time—let your AI understand your codebase like a senior developer.

## ✨ What Makes This Special

🔍 **Automatic Project Analysis** - Scans your codebase to understand patterns, conventions, and architecture  
🎯 **Context-Aware AI Guidance** - Generates project-specific rules that make AI suggestions more relevant  
🛠️ **Universal Compatibility** - Works with 10+ IDEs and AI assistants  
🚀 **Zero Configuration** - Set up in minutes with intelligent detection  
🔄 **Community-Driven** - Sync with latest best practices from the community  

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/idominikosgr/VibeCodingRules.git
cd VibeCodingRules

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the interactive setup wizard
npm run wizard
```

**That's it!** Your AI assistant now understands your project structure, naming conventions, and architectural patterns.

## 🎬 See It In Action

**Before Vibe Coding Rules:**
```
👤 "Create a new user component"
🤖 "Here's a generic React component..."
```

**After Vibe Coding Rules:**
```
👤 "Create a new user component"
🤖 "Based on your project's patterns, I'll create a component following your:
    • TypeScript interfaces from types/User.ts
    • Styled-components architecture
    • Custom hooks pattern from hooks/useAuth.ts
    • Error handling with your ErrorBoundary wrapper"
```

## 🔧 How It Works

1. **Project Analysis** - Scans your codebase to detect technologies, patterns, and conventions
2. **Rule Generation** - Creates `.mdc` rule files with project-specific guidance
3. **AI Enhancement** - Your AI assistant automatically uses these rules for better suggestions
4. **Continuous Learning** - Rules evolve with your project and community best practices
